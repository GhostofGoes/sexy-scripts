OLD - ditched the python implementation in favor of native platform tools.
What can I say, I'm a Pythonista.


A collection of scripts I use for setting up my environment and doing day-to-day tasks.



Usage
=====

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostofgoes/sneaky-scripts
cd sneaky-scripts
pip install -e .
sneaky --help
```

See `resources/sneaky_config.json` for examples on configuration. Full syntax is coming soon.


Works with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, probably 3.7 whenever that drops.

Platforms
* Windows: 10
* Ubuntu: 14, 16
* Kali: 2017+
* CentOS: 6+, 7+

Others TBD as I start spinning up home testbed(s) in the next half-year.
