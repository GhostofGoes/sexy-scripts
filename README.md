A collection of scripts I use for setting up my environment and doing day-to-day tasks.
Uses native platform tools, namely PowerShell on Windows, and BASH on Linux.


If you want to download "LinkedIn" slideshares, there's also a thing for that.



# Usage


* Download repo
* Modify files in configs, if desired
* Modify apps.json for the platform, if desired
* Run the "sneaky" script for the platform

Or copy the snippets you need. No need to do a full repo download. Your mileage may vary.

See README in the directories for details.
