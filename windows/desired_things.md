# Applications
List of applications that end up on most of my windows machines.
Depends on how much desk space is available.
I try to get the latest version of things when possible.
Some of these may already be installed, but need to be updated/configured.

Make this list customizable with a JSON file or something.

Most of these will be installed using Chocolatey.
Some may be done using Ninite.
Rest will be done manually.
